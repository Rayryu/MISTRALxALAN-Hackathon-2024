      "- The question discusses the analysis of molecular biology in the context of diagnosing a tumor, which is a key aspect of anatomical pathology.\n",
      "- Anatomical pathologists examine tissues and cells to diagnose diseases, including cancer. They often use techniques like immunohistochemistry and molecular testing on tissue samples, which can be fixed and embedded in paraffin (option A) or frozen (option B).\n",
      "- They also perform morphological examinations (option D) to ensure the quality and integrity of the tissue samples.\n",
